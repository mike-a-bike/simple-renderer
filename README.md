Simple renderer is what the name suggests a very simple render engine based on the backtracking raytracing algorithm.
It contains just two geometry objects, a plane and a sphere and an orthographic pinhole camera. 

The scene is a default cornell box type containing four planes, two spheres and a single point light source.

Images are save to an image file. No viewer is available.
